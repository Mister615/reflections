When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Users would want to use a remote repository when they would like to collaborate 
    on a project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    As with the manual commits, it allows the user more flexibility and control. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are basically cloned repositories from other authors that gives them
    credit and would be used when you don't have permission to alter their repository
    but want the ability to change/update it.  Clones are repositories that are exact
    replicas of another repository and are used to copy a repository.  Branches exist
    inside repositories as a means of adding features without interrupting the 
    usability of a program.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    As the user makes changes to a project, a comparison can be made with commits of 
    the remote state and this can help merge branches with a contributor.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Collaboration without using Git or Github would be extremely difficult and I 
    don't know of any other way to accomplish it.  Keeping track of all of the 
    changes would probably be most difficult, and I can see this adding the 
    workload for the entire group.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    To test out a new feature that might interfere with the master branch. Also,
    working on seperate branches reduces the confusion and wasted time between 
    team members.
